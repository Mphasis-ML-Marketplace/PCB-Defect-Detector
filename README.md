# PCB-Defect-Detector


## Product Overview

PCB Anomaly Detection is a computer vision-based machine learning solution to identify defects in Through-Hole PCBs. The algorithm identifies 6 different kinds of defects: Missing Hole, Mouse Bite, Spur, Open Circuit, Short Circuit, Spurious copper. The algorithm takes reference PCB templates for analysis and identification of defects in erroneous PCB images.

## Product Highlights
* The solution identifies defects, places a bounding box around it and classifies the type of defect. It can find multiple defects in a single PCB and works well for all types of Through-Hole PCBs
* The solution is rotational invariant for testing data (provided the training data is straight and still). This solution can also ignore the background noise to an extent.
* Mphasis DeepInsights is a cloud-based cognitive computing platform that offers data extraction & predictive analytics capabilities. Need customized Machine Learning and Deep Learning solutions? Get in touch!
